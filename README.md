1. Overview of the Database
 -- This section provides a brief introduction to the purpose and utility of the database. It explains the real-world problem being addressed and how the database structure helps manage and organize data efficiently.

2. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
 -- A detailed ERD is created to define the entities, relationships, and attributes of the database in Romanian. This diagram follows the standard format used in database design courses and helps visualize how different entities interact.

3. Conceptual Model Diagram
 -- Building upon the ERD, a conceptual model is developed that integrates all necessary attributes. This diagram provides a more refined structure of the database, ensuring all data requirements are met while maintaining clarity in entity relationships.

4. Implementation in Oracle
 -- The conceptual model is implemented in Oracle by defining all required tables along with primary keys, foreign keys, and other integrity constraints. This ensures data consistency and correctness in the database schema.

5. Data Insertion
 -- Each independent entity is populated with at least five records, while associative tables contain a minimum of ten records. The data added is coherent and follows real-world logical relationships to maintain consistency.

6. Stored Procedure with Collections
 -- A real-world problem is formulated in natural language and solved using an independent stored procedure that utilizes all three types of studied collections. The procedure is executed to validate its functionality.

7. Stored Procedure with Cursors
 -- A problem is defined and solved using an independent stored procedure that incorporates two different types of cursors, with one being a parameterized cursor dependent on the other. The procedure is executed to ensure correctness.

8. Function-Based Stored Procedure
 -- A problem is addressed using an independent function that performs an SQL query involving three tables. At least two custom exceptions are defined and handled. The function is executed in different scenarios to demonstrate its error-handling capabilities.

9. Procedure-Based Stored Procedure
 -- A real-world scenario is solved using a procedure that executes an SQL query involving five tables. All possible exceptions are handled, including NO_DATA_FOUND and TOO_MANY_ROWS. The procedure is tested to showcase different cases and error handling.

10. Command-Level LMD Trigger
 -- An LMD (Language Manipulation Data) trigger is defined at the command level to automate specific actions when a particular SQL command is executed. The trigger is tested to validate its behavior.

11. Row-Level LMD Trigger
 -- A row-level LMD trigger is implemented to perform operations at the individual row level upon data modifications. The trigger is activated and its functionality is verified.

12. LDD Trigger Implementation
 -- An LDD (Language Definition Data) trigger is created to track schema changes. The trigger is executed, and its effect on the database structure is analyzed.

This documentation ensures a structured approach to database design, implementation, and testing, following best practices in Oracle-based database systems. ðŸš€
